# Swift-iOS-HabitTrackerApp-gruv-testing


Gruv App - Fall 2018 Project

Gruv is an iOS app. Gruv is a Habit Tracker app in Swift and Xcode to track user's habits based on regular input. This app was developed in a group of 5 students.

I was responsible for testing and quality assurance using XCTest framework from Apple and also general Software Engineering. 

These are a sample of tests coded(by me) for the Gruv team project. Tests include UI testing.
